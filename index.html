      Fort Sumter

    <p>Confederate forces fired on the Union-held fort in Charleston Harbor, officially starting the American Civil War.</p>
    <p>Although the bombardment lasted over 30 hours, no soldiers died during the fighting—though two Union soldiers were killed during a misfire at the surrender ceremony.

    <li>The Union commander, Major Robert Anderson, had once been a student of the Confederate commander, General P.G.T. Beauregard, at West Point—making the opening shots of the war feel oddly personal.

      Bull Run
    </header>
    <img class="images" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Second_Battle_of_Bull_Run.jpg">
    <p>This was the first large-scale engagement of the war, resulting in a Confederate victory and shocking the North with the realization that the war would be long and bloody.
    </p>
    <p>Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson earned his famous nickname "Stonewall" for standing firm during the battle, boosting Southern morale.
    </p>

    <li>Civilians from Washington, D.C., packed picnics and rode out to watch the battle, expecting an easy Union victory. They fled in panic when the Union army was routed.

      Antietam

    <img class="images" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Thure_de_Thulstrup_-_Battle_of_Antietam.jpg">
    <p>Over 22,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing in just one day of fighting.
    </p>
    <p>The Union's strategic advantage gave President Lincoln the opportunity to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation shortly afterward.
    </p>
    <code>
    </code>
    <li>The battle could have ended even worse for the Confederates—Union soldiers found a copy of Lee’s battle plans (Special Order 191) wrapped around cigars, but Union General McClellan failed to act quickly enough.
    </li>

      Gettysburg
    </header>

    <p>It marked the furthest advance of Confederate forces into the North and ended Lee's attempt to invade Union territory.
    </p>
    <p>The battle had about 51,000 casualties combined, making it the bloodiest battle of the Civil War.
    </p>
    <code>
    </code>
    <li>The town of Gettysburg had only about 2,400 residents before the battle—but after it, over 51,000 soldiers had been killed, wounded, or captured, and the town had to care for thousands of injured men from both sides.
    </li>

      Chickamauga

    <p>It was the second-bloodiest battle of the Civil War and the most significant Confederate victory in the Western Theater.
    </p>
    <p>After their defeat, Union forces retreated to Chattanooga, where they were soon besieged by Confederate troops, setting the stage for future Union offensives.
    </p>
    <code>
    </code>
    <li>The battle is named after Chickamauga Creek, which comes from a Cherokee word often interpreted as "River of Death"—a hauntingly fitting name for one of the bloodiest battles of the war.
